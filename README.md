# Irrigation Component V5.1 <img src="https://github.com/petergridge/irrigation_component_v4/blob/main/icon.png" alt="drawing" width="75"/>

This release is a significant change in the configuration from Version 4. While the functionality remains the same the configuration is now available through the settings Devices & Services. 

The **custom card https://github.com/petergridge/irrigation_card** V5.1 will render the program options specified in the configuration.

The driver for this project is to provide an easy to use interface for the gardener of the house. The goal is that once the inital configuration is done all the features can be modified using the custom lovelace card. With this upgrade the component is also simple to configure.

This program is essentially a scheduling tool, one user has also used this to schedule the running of his lawn mower, so the use is far broader than I anticipated.

The information provided by the configuraton is evaluated to trigger the irrigation action according to the inputs provided.

Watering can occur in an ECO mode where a water/wait/repeat cycle is run to minimise run off by letting water soak in using several short watering cycles. The wait and repeat configuration is optional.

The rain sensor is implemented as a binary_sensor, this allows practically any combination of sensors to suspend the irrigation. This can be defined at the zone level to allow for covered areas to continue watering while exposed areas are suspended.

Implemented as a switch, you can start a program using the schedule, manually or using an automation. Manually starting a program by turning the switch on will not evaluate the rain sensor rules it will just run the program, as there is an assumption that there is an intent to run the program regardless of sensors.

Only one program can run at a time to prevent multiple solenoids being activated. If program start times result in an overlap the running program will be stopped. Zones can be configured to run concurrently or sequentially using the grouping funtionality.

## INSTALLATION

### HACS installation
Will be available on HACS soon but you can add it as a custom repository.

### Important
* Make sure that all of the objects you reference i.e. switch etc are defined or you will get errors when the irrigationprogram is triggered. Check the log for errors.

### Config Flow
* Define the program using the UI. From Setting, Devices & Services choose 'ADD INTEGRATION'. Search for Irrigation Controller Component.
* Modify programs and zones, add new zones, delete zones
* V4 yaml configuration will be imported, if it fails to load run check configuration first and correct any changes implemented to support this release.
* Imports will occur only once, if you delete the config from the UI it will not reimport
* YAML support will be removed in a future release

### Pre-requisite
* The time_date integration is required
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: time_date
    display_options:
      - 'time'
      - 'date'
```
### Debug
Add the following to your logger section configuration.yaml
```yaml
logger:
    default: warning
    logs:
        custom_components.irrigationprogram: debug
```
### Rain Sensor feature
If a rain sensor is  defined the zone will be ignored when the value of the sensor is True.

If the irrigation program is run manually the rain sensor value is ignored and all zones will run.

The rain sensor is defined in each zone. You can:
* Define the same sensor for each zone 
* Have a different sensor for different areas
If you configure this oprion a helper to ignore the rain sensor is automatically created

### Time or Volume based watering
You can define a 'flow sensor' that provides a volume/minute rate. eg litres per minute. Once defied the 'water' attribute will be read as volume eg 15 litres not 15 minutes. 

### Zone Group
You can optionally group zones to run concurrently or sequentially. The helper will be created automatically to support this. Blank groups or where a zone_group is not defined will be sequential zones. Zones are grouped by having the same text value, for example each zone with a value of 'A' will run concurrently.

### Monitor Controller feature
If this binary sensor is defined it will not execute a schedule if the controller is offline. This is ideal for ESP Home implementations.

### Watering Adjuster feature
As an alternative to the rain sensor you can also use the watering adjustment. With this feature the integrator is responsible to provide the value using a input_number or sensor component. I imagine that this would be based on weather data or a moisture sensor.

See the **https://github.com/petergridge/openweathremaphistory** for a companion custom sensor that may be useful.

Setting *water_adjustment* attribute allows a factor to be applied to the watering time.

* If the factor is 0 no watering will occur
* If the factor is 0.5 watering will run for only half the configured watering time/volume. Wait and repeat attributes are unaffected.
* A factor of 1.1 could also be used to apply 10% more water if required.
* The watering time will always be rounded up to the nearest minute when applying the factor.

The following automation is an example of how a input_number.adjust_run_time could be maintained using template calculation.
```yaml
automation:
- id: '1553507967550'
  alias: rain adjuster
  mode: restart
  trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/1"
  action:
    - service: input_number.set_value
      entity_id: input_number.rain_adjuster
      data:
        value: "{{ value template calculation }}"
```

### Run Days and Run Frequency
Run frequency allows the definition of when the program will run. If no frequency input_select is provided a default one will be generated.

This can be a specific set of days or the number of days between watering events and can be defined at the Program or zone level. Application at the zone level allows different zones to execute at the same time but using varying frequencies. for example: Vege Patch every two days and the Lawn once a week.

* *Run Freq* allows the water to occur at a specified frequency.
For example, every 3 days or only on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. 
Include an option for Off this can be any text in any language.

Defining a Dropdown helper to use with the run_freq attribute, .
```yaml
    options:
      - Off
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
      - Wed, Sat
      - Mon, Wed, Fri
      - Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
```

### ECO feature
The ECO feature allows multiple short watering cycles to be configure for a zone in the program to minimise run off and wastage. Setting the optional configuration of the Wait, Repeat attributes of a zone will enable the feature. 

* *wait* sets the length of time to wait between watering cycles
* *repeat* defines the number of watering cycles to run

### Events

The *zone_turned_on* event provides this information:
```
event_type: irrigation_event
data:
  device_id: afternoon
  action: zone_turned_on
  zone: zone_1
  pump: switch.dummy_pump
origin: LOCAL
time_fired: "2022-08-15T23:33:36.358814+00:00"
context:
  id: 01GAHXP1F6KQWTM6Z6PEJ69KDM
  parent_id: null
  user_id: null
```
An automation can then use this data to fire on the event, in this example it the automation would run only when the *pump* event data is '*switch.pump*'. but you could refine it more to include a specific zone or remove the event data clause and it would run every time the event is triggered. Other triggers can be added if there is a use case for them. Let me know.
``` yaml
alias: pump_keep_alive
description: "Let the pump device know that HA is still alive so it does not time out and shut down"
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: irrigation_event
    event_data:
      pump: switch.pump
      action: zone_turned_on
action: ---- Put your action here ----
mode: single
```
